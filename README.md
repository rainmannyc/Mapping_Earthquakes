# **Mapping Earthquakes**

## **Overview**

The challenge consisted of creating an earthquake map with multi base maps along with tectonic plate overlays & major earthquake overlays. The major earthquake overlays show earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.

We have also created 4 maps in total located in our "multi_map_logic.js" file. The new base map layers include Streets, Satellite, Day, and Night. 

The data was obtained using multiple sources including:
